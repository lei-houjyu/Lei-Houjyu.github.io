I am a final-year M.E. student at School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In the last four years, I have a great experience in Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), where I am advised by [Prof. Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen) and work on memory management in Java runtime.
Currently, I am seeking to apply for a CS/ECE Ph.D. program starting from Fall 2020. I have broad interests in systems, especially operating systems, programming languages, and computer architecture.
