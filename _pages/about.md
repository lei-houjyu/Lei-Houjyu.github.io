I am a final-year M.E. student at School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In the last four years, I have a great experience in Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems ([IPADS](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/)), where I am advised by [Prof. Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen) and work on memory management in Java runtime.

Currently, **I am seeking to apply for a CS/ECE Ph.D. program starting from Fall 2020**. I would like to pursue systems research during my doctoral period. Please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:haoyu.li@sjtu.edu.cn) at any time if you are interested in working with me. Click [here](https://Lei-Houjyu.github.io/files/cv.pdf) for my CV.
