I am a second-year M.E. student of the [School of Software](http://en.se.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). In the last four years, I have a great experience in the Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems ([IPADS](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/)), where I am advised by [Prof. Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen) and work on memory management in the Java Virtual Machine.

I will start my Ph.D. study at [Columbia CS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) from Fall 2020, supervised by [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). Please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:haoyu.li@sjtu.edu.cn) if you are interested in cooperating with me. Click [here](https://Lei-Houjyu.github.io/files/cv.pdf) for my CV.
